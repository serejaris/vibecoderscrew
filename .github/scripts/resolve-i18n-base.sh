# ## Why `.github/scripts/` and not the repo-root `scripts/`
#
# Root `scripts/` holds product and dev tooling that a contributor runs by hand
# (`scrub-lint.sh`, `clean.sh`, `check_npm_audit.py`). This one is workflow-only glue:
# it reads `github.event.*` values that exist nowhere else and is invoked through
# `$GITHUB_WORKSPACE` by three ci.yml steps. It lives next to the workflows that are
# its only caller. Note the repo has no shellcheck step, so a `.sh` is unlinted under
# either path — the placement costs nothing in enforcement.
#
# ## Why a script and not three copies of the same `if`
#
# Three steps in ci.yml need this (`frontend-lint`, `frontend-tests`, and the render
# gate in `e2e`). It used to be an inline three-liner in each, which was tolerable
# while the only case was "a PR passes origin/<base>, a push passes nothing". It is
# not tolerable now that a push passes a bare SHA, because the ref-vs-SHA handling
# and the zero-SHA guard would be triplicated shell that only one of the three would
# get fixed in.
#
# ## Two callers, two shapes
#
#   - **pull_request** — `origin/<base branch>`. A ref name, so it also needs a local
#     `refs/remotes/...` entry for the gates that resolve it by name.
#   - **push to main** — `github.event.before`, the commit this push replaced. A bare
#     SHA, which resolves on its own once fetched; creating `refs/remotes/<sha>` for
#     it would be a nonsense ref.
#
# Giving a push a base is the point of the change that introduced this file: it is
# what lets every i18n gate enforce a DIFF and report totals, instead of failing on
# a stored total that no single diff can be held responsible for. It is a sampled
# backstop rather than a per-commit one — ci.yml's concurrency group evicts a pending
# main run when a newer one queues, so some commits reach main without their own run,
# and their delta then falls between two `before` boundaries. The PR gate remains the
# primary check; this catches the interaction between two branches that passed
# separately, which is the class no PR-scoped diff can see.
