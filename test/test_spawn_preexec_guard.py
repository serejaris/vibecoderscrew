"""No async spawn may hand CPython a ``preexec_fn`` (issue #935).

``preexec_fn`` forces a plain ``fork()`` of the multi-GB, ~118-thread gateway and
runs Python bytecode in the child before ``exec``. A lock another thread held at
fork time cannot be released there, and a child that wedges takes the whole
gateway with it: ``Popen._execute_child`` blocks on the event loop thread in an
unbounded ``os.read(errpipe_read, ...)`` with no ``await`` point for a timeout to
reach, and because ``child_exec()`` closes fds only AFTER ``preexec_fn``, the
orphan keeps a duplicate of every inherited fd -- the dashboard's listening socket
included.

Async spawns go through ``sandbox.create_subprocess_limited``, which applies the
same limits after ``exec``. This is the tripwire that keeps a new call site from
quietly reintroducing the fork.

Synchronous ``subprocess.run`` / ``Popen`` spawns are NOT covered yet: they wedge
a worker thread rather than the event loop. Removing that exemption is tracked as
the follow-up to issue #935.
