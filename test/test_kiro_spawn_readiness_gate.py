"""Poll-driven kiro-cli spawn sites must not run the CLI while signed out.

``kiro-cli`` auto-launches an interactive browser login whenever a subcommand
runs unauthenticated (``--no-interactive`` does not suppress it and there is no
opt-out env var). ``/api/models`` is polled every 8s while the model list is
degraded and ``/api/sessions/usage`` every 30s, so an unauthenticated gateway
used to spawn a browser-opening CLI on every cycle — dozens of browser windows
and an unusable dashboard.

These tests pin the fix: both handlers consult the prerequisite readiness latch
BEFORE resolving or spawning the binary, and return the shared 503 instead.

The signed-out cases drive the REAL ``reject_if_kiro_unverified`` (never a
stubbed guard) and pin binary resolution to a fixed path, so a deleted or
relocated gate must reach ``create_subprocess_exec`` — on a CI runner with no
kiro-cli installed as much as on a developer machine that has one.

Ordinary sends are UNGATED — the ACP attempt reports auth failures itself and
they mutate nothing up front. These two sites (and the destructive reruns, which
rewrite persisted history before their turn) keep failing closed because neither
can use the ACP attempt as its authority.
