"""Tests for chat_runner._context_usage_payload.

Regression guard: the payload must include absolute used/window token counts
when the provider reports a window. The bug this catches shipped green because
nothing exercised the helper — it read last_prompt_stats off the AcpProvider
(where it does not exist) instead of via the provider's public accessors.
