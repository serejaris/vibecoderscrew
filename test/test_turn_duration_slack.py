"""Turn wall clock + timeout-spend recording on the Slack dispatch surface.

``gateway.py`` now measures a local ``time.monotonic()`` wall clock for each
background dispatch turn and passes it as ``elapsed_ms`` to
``persist_token_record_async``. The acp provider never assigns
``TurnUsage.duration_ms`` (it stays 0), so without this the row store recorded
``duration_ms=0`` for every real turn; the record builder now falls back to the
caller's ``elapsed_ms`` when the provider reports nothing (issue #647 / #874
follow-up).

The two ``asyncio.wait_for`` timeout branches (slack heartbeat and the monitor
auto-nudge) previously wrote NO row at all on timeout, silently dropping the
spend the cancelled turn had already incurred. They now record it.

These tests drive the monitor path (``GatewayOrchestrator._fire_slack_nudge``)
end to end because it is a directly-callable method. Its timeout branch has the
same shape as the heartbeat one -- read the provider's accumulated usage off the
still-alive client, then persist with the measured elapsed -- and both go
through the identical ``persist_token_record_async(..., elapsed_ms=...)`` seam.
The heartbeat runner is a closure nested inside ``_init_heartbeat`` and is not
callable in isolation, so it is covered by code review + this shared-shape test
rather than driven directly here.

Assertions capture the compatibility seam handed to ``_build_token_record``;
the source-only release intentionally drops the row before any usage-shard I/O.
