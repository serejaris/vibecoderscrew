"""Contract tests for the publish-docker lane's provenance discipline.

The lane's documented guarantees:

* A CHANNEL alias (nightly/insider/stable/latest) never points at a digest
  without registry-pushed SLSA provenance from this repository.
* The workflow never SIGNS bytes it did not build: attestation is created
  only on the fresh-build path; the existing-tag re-run path instead
  VERIFIES that the already-published digest carries this repo's
  provenance, and fails the job (never moving the alias) when it does not.
* A VERSION tag, once published, is never rebuilt or repointed — and a
  transient registry failure must never be misread as "tag absent" (that
  would rebuild different bytes under a published version).
* The package remains private unless callers explicitly opt into the
  anonymous-pull release gate.
* The lane needs no repository secrets beyond the implicit GITHUB_TOKEN —
  callers must not ``secrets: inherit`` into it.

Each is pinned structurally here because a plausible-looking edit (e.g.
swapping the attest gate, or "simplifying" the inspect error handling back
to ``if cmd 2>/dev/null``) silently re-opens a provenance or immutability
hole that only manifests on rare re-run/outage paths CI never exercises.
