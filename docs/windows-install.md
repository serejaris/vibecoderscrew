# Installing & Testing KiroCrew on Windows

KiroCrew runs **natively on Windows** as a Python **source install**.
The cross-platform process / signal / file-lock / metrics behavior is routed
through `kiro_crew.platform_compat`, so macOS + Linux behavior is unchanged and
the same code path also runs on Windows.

## Desktop installer (preview, CI-built)

CI's Windows lane (`build-windows.yml`) also builds a Windows desktop app:
`KiroCrew Setup.exe` plus the Squirrel.Windows `RELEASES`/`.nupkg` pair, with
the backend bundled (no separate Python install needed). It has its own
workflow rather than being a leg of `build-desktop.yml` because Authenticode
signing has to happen *during* the build — a Squirrel `Setup.exe` embeds its
own already-signed executables — so that job needs AWS credentials the shared
build workflow deliberately does not hold. Current status:

- **CI artifact only** — produced on nightly/release runs and the manual
  `workflow_dispatch` probe; not yet published to the download CDN (that is
  the upcoming `publish-windows.yml` lane).
- **Signing wired but not yet active** — the AWS Signer path is in place and
  skips cleanly until the signing profiles are provisioned, so today's
  installers are still unsigned and SmartScreen shows an "unrecognized app"
  interstitial (More info > Run anyway).
- **No auto-update yet** — the macOS/Linux client moved to
  electron-updater (`latest-mac.yml` / `latest-linux.yml` feeds), but its
  win32 path drives NSIS installers, not Squirrel.Windows, so win32 stays
  excluded from the updater (`SUPPORTED_PLATFORMS` in `auto-update.js`)
  until the NSIS migration lands (issue #598); installs update by running
  a newer Setup.exe.

The source install below remains the fully supported path.

## Prerequisites

| Tool | Why | Get it |
|------|-----|--------|
| **Git for Windows** | clone the repo | https://git-scm.com/download/win |
| **kiro-cli** | the agent backend (ACP); the first dashboard launch can install it | Vibecoders Crew setup page or kiro-cli's native Windows release |
| **Python 3.10–3.12** | the venv runtime (3.12 preferred; numpy 1.x has no 3.13 wheel) | https://python.org — install user-scoped, or `winget install Python.Python.3.12` |
| **Node.js** (optional) | builds the full React dashboard; without it the gateway serves the prebuilt bundle | `winget install OpenJS.NodeJS.LTS` |

No admin is required — everything installs user-scoped under `%USERPROFILE%`.

Avoid the Microsoft Store `python` alias stub: KiroCrew's interpreter finder
(`platform_compat.find_python_interpreter`) rejects it, but a Store-only `python`
on `PATH` can still confuse other tooling. Prefer a real CPython install.

## Install (native)

From a clone, in PowerShell:

```powershell
git clone https://github.com/serejaris/vibecoderscrew.git
cd kirocrew

# Build the frontend first (optional but recommended) so the dashboard is bundled:
#   cd website; npm install; npm run build; cd ..
#   Copy-Item -Recurse website\dist src\kiro_crew\static\dist

py -3.12 -m venv .venv
.\.venv\Scripts\Activate.ps1
python -m pip install --upgrade pip
# tzdata: Windows has no system IANA tz database, so zoneinfo.ZoneInfo() needs it.
# (setup.cfg already declares tzdata under a platform_system == "Windows" marker,
#  so a plain `pip install -e .` pulls it in on Windows.)
pip install -e ".[voice]"
```

Then:

```powershell
kirocrew setup
kirocrew gateway
```

Open the dashboard URL printed by the gateway. On first launch, Vibecoders Crew checks
the **Windows gateway host** for a runnable and authenticated Kiro CLI. If it is
missing, choose **Install Kiro CLI** to download and run the fixed official
PowerShell installer; if it is signed out, choose **Sign in to Kiro** and
complete the device-code flow in the browser. The dashboard opens automatically
after `kiro-cli whoami` succeeds. This setup runs on the gateway machine, which
may be different from the computer running the browser.

`kirocrew` / `kirocrew-browse` land in `.venv\Scripts\`. If a launched (non-shell)
gateway can't find the built-in `kirocrew-cron` / `kirocrew-core` MCP servers,
that dir is appended to the MCP spawn `PATH` automatically
(`env.augmented_path`), and the managed-server invocation falls back to
`python -m kiro_crew <sub>` when the `kirocrew.exe` wrapper isn't resolvable.

## Per-feature status on Windows

| Feature | Status on Windows |
|---------|-------------------|
| Core gateway / chat / cron / dashboard | works |
| Pull-request source drawer provider fetch/check/resolve | not yet — provider CLIs require the POSIX OS-level sandbox and fail closed with a clear unsupported response |
| Browser automation (Playwright MCP) | works (installed via `npm`/`npx @playwright/mcp`) |
| Vector memory / embeddings | via a **remote embedding endpoint or Docker**; local Ollama auto-install is not yet supported |
| STT (whisper / optional cloud transcription) | works |
| Voice reply (Piper TTS) | not yet — upstream rhasspy/piper ships no Windows binary; Polly (optional) works if the `aws` CLI is present |
| SSH tunnel (`kirocrew cloud` remote dashboard) | not yet — needs the OpenSSH client on `PATH` and a signal-handling audit |
| MCP gateway (opt-in, OFF by default) | works — a named-pipe transport replaces the AF_UNIX socket, and the peer check uses `GetNamedPipeClientProcessId` + a SID comparison in place of `SO_PEERCRED`. Still opt-in: set `mcp_gateway.enabled` to turn it on |
| Papyrus (LaTeX editor, opt-in builtin) | works, **but compiling and git need the `agent.sandbox_allow_unsandboxed_exec` opt-in above** — like chat, its spawns route through `wrap_argv`, which fail-closes where no OS sandbox backend exists. Without it, compile and clone/commit/push/pull answer a clear 422 (`compiler_sandbox_unavailable` / `git_sandbox_unavailable`) naming the remedy rather than a bare "internal error". The managed Tectonic compiler is Windows-pinned (`x86_64-pc-windows-msvc`); Windows-on-ARM has no upstream asset and keeps the manual install path |

The not-yet items are tracked as Windows feature-parity follow-ups.

## Secret-at-rest posture on Windows

Files under `%USERPROFILE%\.kiro\crew` that hold auth material — the token
signing key, refresh-token state, per-app secrets, snapshot tarballs, and the
cron internal-secret temp file — are locked down to the current user via an
owner-only NTFS DACL (inheritance stripped, `S-1-3-4:F` = Owner Rights full
control). This is applied through `platform_compat.restrict_to_owner`, which
routes to `os.chmod(..., 0o600)` on POSIX and `icacls /inheritance:r /grant:r
"*S-1-3-4:F"` on Windows. Failure is fail-loud (raises `OSError`) so the
security-warning handlers in each caller fire — a naive `if IS_POSIX: os.chmod`
guard would silently no-op on Windows, leaving secrets group/world-readable
under NTFS.

## Troubleshooting

- **`ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'fcntl'`** — you installed a
  branch/commit that predates the Windows port. `fcntl` is a Unix-only Python
  stdlib module; it cannot be pip-installed on Windows. Update to a build that
  routes locking through `platform_compat`.
- **`ZoneInfoNotFoundError` / "No time zone found"** — install `tzdata`
  (`pip install tzdata`); Windows has no system IANA tz database.
- **"Python was not found" (Microsoft Store)** — a bare `python`/`python3` was
  resolving the Store alias stub; install a real CPython and ensure it precedes
  the stub on `PATH`.
- **`kirocrew stop` reports "No KiroCrew gateway currently running" on a
  non-English Windows** — `find_listening_pids` matches the `netstat` state
  against the wildcard foreign address and the literal English `LISTENING`;
  some localized Windows editions emit translated state names. Workaround:
  `netstat -ano | findstr :5476` to find the PID and `taskkill /F /PID <pid>`.
- **Web terminal / interactive SSO login panels** — unavailable on Windows
  (they need `pty`/`fork`/`termios`); they return a clear "not supported on
  Windows" response instead of crashing.
