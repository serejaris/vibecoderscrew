# Running KiroCrew in Docker

> The published `ghcr.io/kirodotdev/kirocrew` image belongs to upstream and
> does not contain the Codex Edition changes. This community release is
> source-only; build a local image from this repository if you need a container.

The official image runs the KiroCrew **gateway** — dashboard, channel bots
(Slack / Discord / Telegram / WeCom / Webex), crons, and the kiro-cli agent
runtime — as a headless container. It is the recommended way to run KiroCrew
24/7 on a server or NAS; the strongest fit is the always-on channel bot that
does not need a desktop session.

The image is public, so no registry login is needed. Start the gateway:

```
docker run -d --name kirocrew \
  -p 127.0.0.1:5476:5476 \
  -v kirocrew-home:/home/kirocrew \
  ghcr.io/kirodotdev/kirocrew:stable
```

Or with compose: copy [`docker/compose.yaml`](../docker/compose.yaml) and run
`docker compose up -d`.

## Images and tags

| Tag | Meaning |
|-----|---------|
| `stable` / `latest` | Latest stable release (moves on each stable cut) |
| `insider` | Latest insider pre-release |
| `nightly` | Latest nightly build |
| `0.1.0`, `0.1.0-insider.4`, `0.1.0-nightly.202607261234` | Exact immutable versions |

`linux/amd64` and `linux/arm64` are published under every tag. Version tags
are never repointed once published; pin a version tag (or a digest) for
reproducible deployments. Every published manifest carries SLSA build
provenance — verify with:

```
gh attestation verify oci://ghcr.io/kirodotdev/kirocrew:stable --repo kirodotdev/KiroCrew
```

## First-run setup

Two one-time steps after the container is up:

1. **Log in the agent runtime** (chat sessions run on kiro-cli):

   ```
   docker exec -it kirocrew kiro-cli login
   ```

   Credentials persist in the `kirocrew-home` volume, so login survives
   container upgrades.

2. **Open the dashboard** — every request requires a token; mint a login
   link yourself:

   ```
   docker exec kirocrew kirocrew token --ttl 2h
   ```

   Open the printed link, substituting the host you reach the container on
   (with the mapping above: `http://localhost:5476/?token=...`). Login links
   expire minutes after minting — mint, then open immediately. (The gateway
   also prints one link at boot, as on every platform; by the time you read
   it in `docker logs` it has usually expired, so `docker exec` minting is
   the reliable path.)

## Configuration

Channel credentials load from the environment (or from `.env` in the data
home). Pass them with `-e` / compose `environment:`:

| Variable | Purpose |
|----------|---------|
| `SLACK_BOT_TOKEN`, `SLACK_APP_TOKEN`, `KIROCREW_OWNER_ID` | Slack bot (Socket Mode) |
| `DISCORD_BOT_TOKEN` | Discord bot |
| `TELEGRAM_BOT_TOKEN` | Telegram bot |
| `WECOM_BOT_ID`, `WECOM_SECRET` | WeCom bot |
| `WEBEX_BOT_TOKEN` | Webex bot |
| `KIROCREW_PORT` | Dashboard port (default 5476) |
| `KIROCREW_BIND` | Bind address inside the container (image default `0.0.0.0`; see below) |
| `KIROCREW_ALLOW_UNSANDBOXED` | Set `1` to explicitly allow agent exec without the inner sandbox (see Sandbox below) |

Credential hygiene: on every start the entrypoint moves the channel
credentials it finds in the environment into the data home's `.env` file
(mode 600) and removes them from the gateway's environment before the
gateway starts — so they never sit in the long-lived gateway process's
`/proc/<pid>/environ`. Environment values win over previously stored ones
(same precedence the gateway itself applies), so changing a value in your
compose `.env` and restarting updates the stored copy.

Everything else lives in `config.json` inside the volume. Most settings are
editable from the (token-authenticated) dashboard; the exceptions are the
channel-credential pages (Slack/Discord/Telegram/WeCom/Webex tokens) and
secret-revealing views, which are read-only for any non-direct-local
browser. The image ships no text editor, so edit those from the host —
copy the file out, change it, copy it back, restart:

```
docker cp kirocrew:/home/kirocrew/.kiro/crew/config.json .
# edit config.json locally, then:
docker cp config.json kirocrew:/home/kirocrew/.kiro/crew/config.json
# docker cp writes the file root-owned; hand it back to the gateway user
# (uid 1000) or the dashboard can never save settings again:
docker exec -u 0 kirocrew chown kirocrew:kirocrew /home/kirocrew/.kiro/crew/config.json
docker restart kirocrew
```

(Or use environment variables / `.env` for the credential cases above,
which need no file edit at all.)

## State and upgrades

All persistent state — gateway home (`~/.kiro/crew`), kiro-cli credentials,
agents, skills — lives under `/home/kirocrew`. One named volume covers all
of it. Upgrade by pulling the newer image; state carries over:

```
docker compose pull && docker compose up -d
```

There is no in-container auto-update: the image is immutable and the tag is
the version selector (channel tags track their channel; version tags pin).

## Networking and security model

- **Why `KIROCREW_BIND=0.0.0.0`:** outside Docker the gateway binds
  loopback only. Inside a container, published ports (`-p`) map to the
  container's bridge interface, so a loopback bind would be unreachable
  from the host. The image therefore binds all interfaces **inside the
  container's network namespace** — nothing is reachable from anywhere
  until you publish the port, and `-p 127.0.0.1:5476:5476` keeps it
  host-local.
- **Auth surface, precisely:** the API and WebSocket surface requires a
  valid dashboard token (cookie or minted link) regardless of bind
  address. Three deliberate carve-outs exist, none of which serve secrets:
  1. **Liveness probes** — `/api/health`, `/api/live`, `/api/ready` are
     tokenless AND exempt from the DNS-rebinding Host check (orchestrators
     address containers by IP). Their payloads are secret-free; the build
     identity fields are additionally stripped unless the caller is
     direct-local with a served Host.
  2. **Static assets** — the SPA shell, `/assets/`, `/vendor/`, and
     similar non-secret static files are served without a token (standard
     SPA bootstrap; the app is useless without a token once loaded).
  3. **Local bootstrap** — `/api/token/local` and `/api/shutdown` require
     a loopback peer **plus** a filesystem secret, so they are unreachable
     through the published port by construction.
  CSRF origin checks apply to all state-changing requests, and the
  DNS-rebinding Host barrier applies to every request except the three
  probe paths.
- **Exposing beyond localhost:** publishing `5476:5476` opens the TCP
  port, but LAN browsers will still be rejected until their origin is
  allowed — set `dashboard.url` (or `KIROCREW_CORS_ORIGINS`) to the
  address you browse from. The supported pattern is a TLS reverse proxy
  in front with `dashboard.url` set to its origin, exactly as for a
  non-container deployment.
- **Sandbox:** on first run the entrypoint probes whether KiroCrew's inner
  Linux user-namespace sandbox works under the container runtime's
  seccomp/AppArmor policy. If it does, it seeds `agent.sandbox="auto"` so
  agent commands run namespace-isolated from gateway state, same as a
  hardened native install. If no backend works, agent command execution
  stays DISABLED (fail-closed) — the gateway, dashboard, and channel bots
  run normally. To enable agents in that situation, either permit user
  namespaces (`--security-opt seccomp=<profile permitting unshare/clone>`)
  and restart, or restart with `-e KIROCREW_ALLOW_UNSANDBOXED=1` to
  explicitly accept unsandboxed agent execution. In the consented posture
  the container is the only isolation boundary: treat its contents
  (mounted volumes included) as reachable by agent commands, and do not
  mount host paths you would not hand to the agent. The startup log states
  which posture was chosen.

## Health

The image ships a `HEALTHCHECK` against `/api/health`. Orchestrators can use
`/api/live` and `/api/ready` for liveness/readiness probes; all three are
token-free and secret-free.

## Building locally

The image consumes a built wheel (never the raw source tree), keeping Docker
bytes identical to pip bytes for a given version:

```
make wheel                                   # builds dist/kirocrew-*.whl
docker build -f docker/Dockerfile -t kirocrew:dev .
```
