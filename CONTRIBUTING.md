# Contributing to Vibecoders Crew

Thanks for your interest in contributing! Vibecoders Crew is an open-source project and
we welcome issues and pull requests.

This repository is the unofficial VibecodersCrew community fork. Its
default branch is `codex-main`; upstream KiroCrew remains at
[`kirodotdev/KiroCrew`](https://github.com/kirodotdev/KiroCrew). Please open
Codex-provider and fork-release issues here.

## Reporting Bugs and Requesting Features

Open a [GitHub issue](https://github.com/serejaris/vibecoderscrew/issues). Before you
do, search the open issues, because the fastest resolution is often a thread that
already exists.

For a bug, what actually helps is a way to reproduce it, the version you are on,
your operating system, and anything unusual about how Vibecoders Crew is installed or
where it runs. A stack trace beats a description of a stack trace. If it only
happens on one surface, say which one, because the dashboard, the CLI, and a chat
channel take different paths through the code.

For a feature, lead with the problem rather than the design. What you were trying
to do and what stopped you tells a maintainer more than a proposed solution, and
it leaves room for an answer nobody had thought of.

## Finding Something to Work On

Two labels mark work that is ready for someone outside the core team.
[`good first issue`](https://github.com/serejaris/vibecoderscrew/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3A%22good+first+issue%22)
is scoped small and does not assume much context.
[`help wanted`](https://github.com/serejaris/vibecoderscrew/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3A%22help+wanted%22)
is work the team wants done but is not doing right now.

Before starting anything substantial, check whether someone is already on it and
comment on the issue saying you are picking it up. For a large change, open an
issue first and get a reaction to the approach. Nobody enjoys declining a
finished pull request that went the wrong direction, and a maintainer can usually
tell you in a paragraph.

## Prerequisites

- macOS or Linux (Windows is not supported by the `kiro-cli` backend)
- Python ≥ 3.9
- Node.js ≥ 18 and npm (for the frontend)
- A logged-in Codex CLI or the ChatGPT desktop app for `agent.provider = codex`
- Optional: `kiro-cli` on `PATH` for `agent.provider = acp`
- [Ollama](https://ollama.com) for memory and knowledge-library embeddings

## First-Time Setup

```bash
# 1. Fork the repo on GitHub, then clone your fork
git clone https://github.com/serejaris/vibecoderscrew.git
cd vibecoderscrew

# 2. Build the frontend and bundle it into the package
cd website
npm install
npm run build
cp -r dist ../src/kiro_crew/static/dist
cd ..

# 3. Editable backend install (with optional voice extras)
python -m venv .venv && source .venv/bin/activate
pip install -e ".[voice]"

# 4. Configure and verify
kirocrew setup               # data dir, agent backend, Slack tokens (optional)
kirocrew doctor              # verify everything works
kirocrew gateway             # start server (dashboard + Slack)
```

The dashboard is at `http://localhost:5476`.

**Dashboard-only mode**: skip Slack tokens during `kirocrew setup` to run
without Slack.

## Development Skills (agents and humans)

The contributor workflow is codified as agent-loadable skills in
[`skills/kirocrew-dev/`](skills/kirocrew-dev/) — the canonical definition of
how code gets written, tested, and reviewed here:

- **`kirocrew-worktree-dev`** — the HARD RULE workflow: every change in a git
  worktree, the blocking build gates, the built-dist gotcha, preview paths.
- **`prepare-pr`** — drives working-tree changes to a review-ready PR
  (commit → sync → squash → open → poll CI/review bots → fix findings).
- **`babysit`** — same-session monitoring loop that keeps a PR moving through
  CI and review rounds.

An agent contributing to Vibecoders Crew loads this suite and follows the same
worktree → build gate → prepare-pr → review loop human contributors use, so
the PR process stays consistent regardless of who is writing the code. If you
change the workflow, change it THERE — those files are the single source of
truth (with `.github/workflows/ci.yml` canonical for the gate list).

## Building

### Backend

```bash
pip install -e ".[voice]"    # installs deps + console scripts
pytest                       # run the test suite
```

### Frontend

The React SPA lives in `website/`. Production builds are bundled into
`src/kiro_crew/static/dist/` and served by the backend.

```bash
cd website
npm install
npm run build                # tsc + vite build → website/dist
```

After building, copy `website/dist` into `src/kiro_crew/static/dist/` so the
backend serves the latest assets (the `pip` build step copies this directory
into the wheel).

## Dev Mode (Isolated Data Directory)

Run a dev gateway alongside production without data or port conflicts:

```bash
# Seed dev data from your real config (optional, safe to re-run)
./dev-seed.sh

# Start the dev backend (port 6777, isolated data)
KIROCREW_HOME=.kirocrew-dev KIROCREW_PORT=6777 kirocrew gateway
```

Browse at `http://localhost:6777`. The backend serves the built frontend assets directly.

| Env var | Purpose | Default |
|---------|---------|---------|
| `KIROCREW_HOME` | Config/data directory override | `~/.kiro/crew` |
| `KIROCREW_PORT` | Dashboard port override | `5476` |
| `KIROCREW_KIRO_BIN` | Explicit path to the `kiro-cli` binary (overrides PATH auto-detection) | auto-detected |

If you don't need to run production and dev side by side, omit `KIROCREW_PORT` —
just stop your production gateway first.

### Full-Stack Dev Setup (Backend + Frontend Hot-Reload)

When working on frontend changes, run the Vite dev server alongside the backend
for instant hot-reload without rebuilding:

```bash
# Terminal 1 — start the backend
KIROCREW_HOME=.kirocrew-dev KIROCREW_PORT=6777 kirocrew gateway

# Terminal 2 — start the frontend dev server (hot-reloads .tsx changes)
cd website
KIROCREW_PORT=6777 npm run dev
# → Vite starts at http://localhost:3000, proxies /api/* to backend on port 6777

# Terminal 3 — generate an auth token
KIROCREW_HOME=.kirocrew-dev KIROCREW_PORT=6777 kirocrew token
# → Outputs: http://localhost:6777?token=eyJ...

# Open in browser — replace :6777 with :3000:
# http://localhost:3000?token=eyJ...
# Vite's token proxy plugin handles the auth handshake.
```

**Key points:**

- The backend must be reinstalled or restarted after Python source changes
- The frontend hot-reloads automatically — no rebuild for `.tsx`/`.ts`/`.css` changes
- Always access via `localhost:3000` (Vite) during frontend dev, not `localhost:6777` directly
- If the backend restarts, you may need a new token (sessions expire with the process)

## Releasing New Versions

VibecodersCrew publishes source-first GitHub releases from
`codex-main`. Amazon's signing, CDN, installer, telemetry, and update lanes are
not reused by the community fork.

### Cutting a source release

The current corrective candidate is v1.0.1. A public release contains source
archives and notes only; desktop installers, binary update feeds, and signing
artifacts are outside this fork's release boundary.

```bash
# 1. Update CHANGELOG.md and every product version manifest below.
# 2. Run the planned backend, frontend, Electron, type, lint, security, and
#    packaging gates; record any not-yet-run gate as pending in release notes.
# 3. Commit with a Conventional Commit.
git tag -a vX.Y.Z-codex.N -m "VibecodersCrew X.Y.Z preview N"
git push origin codex-main
git push origin vX.Y.Z-codex.N
gh release create vX.Y.Z-codex.N --prerelease --generate-notes
```

The release notes must state that the release contains source archives only.
Desktop artifacts are not attached. Update `CHANGELOG.md` with a
`## [X.Y.Z] — YYYY-MM-DD` section using the format in AGENTS.md.

### Bumping the in-code version

The in-code version governs **non-tag** builds — nightly and local/source
installs. A tagged release overrides all three manifests at build time, so this
is what makes nightlies read as previews of the *next* release:

| File | Field |
|------|-------|
| `src/kiro_crew/__init__.py` | `__version__` — the runtime source of truth |
| `pyproject.toml` | `[project] version` — what local package builds carry |
| `website/package.json` + `package-lock.json` | dashboard package metadata |
| `website/electron/package.json` + `package-lock.json` | local Electron metadata |
| `site/package.json` + `package-lock.json` | landing-site package metadata |

Keep every product manifest version as the same bare `X.Y.Z`. The Git tag may
carry the `-codex.N` prerelease marker without changing those source values.

## Extending Vibecoders Crew

- **Skills** — drop markdown files in `skills/` or `~/.kiro/crew/skills/`. See [skills/README.md](skills/README.md) for the full format reference
- **MCP tools** — add to `mcp_core.py` or `mcp_cron.py`. Every LLM-facing command must have an MCP tool
- **Hooks** — configure in `~/.kiro/crew/config.json`
- **Lessons** — self-learned from corrections, stored in `~/.kiro/crew/lessons.jsonl`

## Tests

### Backend Tests

```bash
pytest                       # full suite (pytest-asyncio, pytest-xdist)
pytest -k test_name          # single test
```

| Pattern | Example |
|---------|---------|
| File naming | `test/test_<module>.py` |
| Async tests | `@pytest.mark.asyncio` required |
| Filesystem | `tmp_path` fixture |
| Config | `monkeypatch` for overrides |
| External processes | Always mock the agent backend, never spawn real processes |
| Grouping | `class TestFeatureName:` |

### Frontend Tests

```bash
cd website
npm test                     # vitest (unit/component) + electron tests
npm run check                # typecheck + lint + tests
npm run test:integration     # MSW-based integration tests
npm run test:playwright      # E2E (requires a running backend)
```

## Using AI Tools

Most of us build with coding agents, and you are welcome to. This project exists
because of that kind of work.

You are still the author of your pull request. Before you open it, make sure you
understand the change well enough to explain why it works, defend the design, and
fix it when something breaks later. If you could not walk a reviewer through it
line by line, it is not ready, and a reviewer will find that out faster than you
expect.

Three things make agent-assisted contributions land:

Keep the change small and focused on one thing. A large diff that touches many
areas is harder to review than the same work split into three, and it is the most
common reason a well-intentioned pull request stalls.

Open an issue first for anything significant, so the approach is agreed before you
or your agent spend real time on it.

Read every line before you send it. Delete what is not needed, simplify what is
over-built, and check that the tests exercise the behaviour rather than merely
passing. Trimming your own diff is the single highest-leverage thing you can do to
get it merged.

When your change is ready, the workflow is already codified rather than left to
taste. See Development Skills above: `kirocrew-worktree-dev` covers building and
verifying in a worktree, and `prepare-pr` takes it from there, driving the change
to a review-ready pull request by committing, syncing onto the base, squashing to
the single commit this repo requires, opening or updating the PR, then polling CI
and the review bots and fixing what they find. An agent that loads it follows the
same route a maintainer would, which is why the process holds regardless of who or
what wrote the code. If you are contributing with an agent, point it at that skill
instead of describing the steps yourself.

## Pull Request Workflow

1. **Fork** the repository on GitHub.
2. **Branch** from `codex-main`:
   ```bash
   git fetch origin
   git checkout -b feat/my-feature origin/codex-main
   ```
3. **Make your change** and add tests (new functions/components should be tested).
4. **Run the checks locally** before opening a PR:
   ```bash
   pytest                                   # backend
   cd website && npm run check && cd ..     # frontend: typecheck + lint + tests
   ```
5. **Commit** using [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/)
   (see below), push to your fork, and open a **Pull Request against `codex-main`**.
6. A maintainer will review. Address feedback by pushing additional commits to
   your branch.

Two things are worth knowing before you start something large.
[GOVERNANCE.md](GOVERNANCE.md) covers who decides what lands and how a
disagreement gets resolved, and [MAINTAINERS.md](MAINTAINERS.md) lists the
people doing it.

Architectural changes get written up as an RFC first, in
[docs/request-for-change/](docs/request-for-change/), so the design can be
argued over before anyone writes the code. That applies to changes to a public
interface, changes other parts of the project would have to build around, and
anything that would be expensive to reverse. Everything else skips it, and a bug
fix should never wait on a design document. If you are unsure which side of the
line your change falls on, open an issue and ask.

### CI checks on your PR

Fork pull requests run the credential-free tests, lint, typecheck, CodeQL,
coverage, and build checks. Amazon Bedrock review jobs and Amazon release jobs
are outside this community fork's CI contract. Never add repository secrets to
make an inherited upstream-only workflow run.
