# Modified 2026 by Sereja Ris for VibecodersCrew (community fork of Kiro Crew).
# See NOTICE and CHANGELOG.md for the nature of the modifications.
"""Shared helpers for building the VibecodersCrew website frontend assets.

The canonical frontend lives **in-tree** at ``<repo-root>/website`` (a Vite +
React app). Its ``npm run build`` output lands in ``<repo-root>/website/dist``
and must be staged into ``<repo-root>/src/kiro_crew/static/dist`` so the
gateway can serve the SPA. Everything here operates on that in-tree layout.

For backwards compatibility with side-by-side dev checkouts, a *sibling*
``VibecodersCrewWebsite/dist`` checkout is honored as a last-resort fallback
when resolving an already-built dist at runtime (see
``ensure_dev_dist_symlink``).

    The dashboard serves its SPA from ``<kiro_crew>/static/dist/index.html``.
    A ``pip``/wheel install ships that directory pre-bundled (the npm build
    output is committed/packaged into the wheel). That path does not fire on a
    plain source-tree run (``PYTHONPATH=src python -m kiro_crew gateway``,
    ``dev-backend.sh``, etc.), so without this the gateway has no SPA bundle
    and serves the "not found" guidance page.

    This helper reconciles the gap at gateway start:

    1. Existing real directory with ``index.html`` → no-op (packaged install /
       a prior local build that populated the source tree / manual setup).
    2. Existing symlink → validated; dangling or empty targets get replaced.
    3. Missing → resolve the in-tree ``website/dist`` (or a sibling
       ``VibecodersCrewWebsite`` checkout as a last resort) and symlink to it.

    Symlink over copy: no source-tree churn, ``.gitignore`` already excludes
    ``static/dist/``, and a fresh ``website`` rebuild propagates to the gateway
    with no extra step.

    Returns the resolved dist path on success, ``None`` if nothing could be
    found (caller should warn; the gateway then serves the "not built"
    guidance page — there is no legacy dashboard fallback).
