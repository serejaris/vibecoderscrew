"""Cross-platform Kiro CLI prerequisite detection, install, and login.

The public KiroCrew provider is KiroACP-only, so a healthy, authenticated
``kiro-cli`` is a hard runtime prerequisite.  This module owns the fixed,
operator-triggered setup operations used by the dashboard:

* discover and validate an installed Kiro CLI;
* download the official HTTPS installer and execute it without a shell string;
* start Kiro's device-flow login and surface its HTTPS sign-in URL.

No command, argument, URL, or filesystem target is accepted from an HTTP
request.  The dashboard handlers expose only ``status``, ``install``, and
``login`` verbs.

    exec'ing a SIBLING executable (e.g. ``kiro-cli-chat``) that it locates
    relative to its own path — on macOS by finding ``.app/Contents/MacOS/`` in

        the status route is an ``add_get``, and both dashboard barriers are

        operation in this service — including the read-only probes — audits.

        Only rebuilds when the MAIN spec is absent, which keeps it out of a
        lost-update class: ``rebuild_agent_config`` regenerates the whole file and

        no file on disk there is nothing to lose (the toggle path itself bails
        with "Cannot read agent config, skipping sync").

        Failure is returned rather than raised: the caller reports it in the
