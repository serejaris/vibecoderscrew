"""Explicit allowlist of user-facing docs eligible for the tips catalog.

Single source of truth shared by the runtime fallback scanner
(``kiro_crew.tips._scan_docs_catalog``) and the release-time generator
(``scripts/generate_tips_catalog.py``).

Only USER-FACING feature docs belong here. Internal architecture notes,
incident write-ups, and design documents must NOT be listed — the exploration
blend picks uniformly from the catalog, so anything listed can surface as a
user-facing tip.

Deliberately dependency-free so the maintainer script can import it without
pulling in the full kiro_crew runtime.
