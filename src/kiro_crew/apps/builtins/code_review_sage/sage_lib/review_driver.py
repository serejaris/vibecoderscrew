"""Review driver — code-enforced two-stage review loop.

Neither the clean-session-per-change guarantee NOR the Phase 1 -> Phase 2 switch
is left to the LLM. This deterministic driver owns both:

  Stage 1 (gate)  — spawn an isolated Phase-1-ONLY session per change; it writes
                    a gate-only result record (phase1 + blast_radius).
  Phase switch    — the driver READS the recorded gate_verdict. Every usable
                    verdict (PASS, CONCERNS, BLOCK) proceeds to Phase 2: a design
                    BLOCK informs the ship decision but does NOT skip the code
                    review, so the author sees all issues in one pass.
  Stage 2 (deep)  — for any usable verdict: spawn a second isolated session that
                    runs the Phase 2 dimensions and augments the record with
                    findings.

Both stages run on a **reusable worker pool** (``sage_lib/review_pool.py``): a bounded
set of long-lived ``AcpClient`` sessions, NOT a fresh ``/api/spawn`` sub-agent
per change. The driver hands each task to the pool via an injected ``dispatch``
callable and the call returns when that task's session finishes its turn (i.e.
the result record is on disk) — so there is no done-flag polling, no lingering
worker, and no reaper. Because pool workers are direct ACP sessions they bypass
the SubagentManager entirely: no agent card, no ``:lock:`` approval prompt, no
Slack relay — the review runs silently. Each reused worker is reset to a clean
conversation between CRs so reviews never cross-contaminate.

The driver then builds the Focus Report deterministically. The orchestrating
session cannot review inline because the driver owns the dispatch. The per-change
*judgment* (the gate verdict and the findings) still runs in each isolated worker
session using the code-review-sage ruleset — Python enforces the structure and
the phase switch, not the verdict itself.

Usage:
    python3 sage_lib/review_driver.py run --changes "<pr-url>[,<pr-url>...]" [--concurrency 3]
