    transcript without discarding the bucket. Generation 0 is the bare bucket
    (no suffix).

    ``dm_scope``:
      * ``per-channel-peer`` (default) -- one bucket per ``(channel, user)``, so
        the same person on Telegram vs WeCom stays isolated.
      * ``unified`` -- direct (1:1) DMs collapse into a single ``unified:{agent}``

        ``{channel}:{agent}:{chat_type}:{user}`` bucket regardless of dm_scope,
        so private DM content can never collapse into a shared group Topic.

    An unrecognized ``dm_scope`` falls back to per-channel-peer (safe isolation)
    rather than raising, so a hand-edited config can never crash dispatch.

    The ``agent`` is part of the durable bucket by design: a different agent is a
    different assistant/context, so switching the configured agent intentionally
    starts a fresh session rather than replaying another agent's history. The
    Telegram/WeCom DM channels carry no prior persisted history to migrate, so
    this key shape applies to them directly; the legacy bare-thread Slack keys
    keep their compatibility shim (see ``canonical_key``) untouched.
