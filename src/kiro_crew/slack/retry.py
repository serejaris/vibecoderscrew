"""Shared Slack DM-open retry.

ONE bounded-retry implementation for every DM sender (today: cron delivery
in the Slack gateway) so retryability classification and backoff cannot
drift between callers.  ``open_dm`` is the transient-failure-prone step
(rate limits, 5xx, network blips); ``post_message`` deliberately stays
single-shot at each call site to avoid duplicate DMs.
