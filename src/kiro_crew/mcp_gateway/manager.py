"""Supervise the KiroCrew MCP gateway subprocess.

Lifecycle:

1. :meth:`GatewayManager.start` — spawn ``python -m
   kiro_crew.mcp_gateway.gatewayd``, wait until the unix socket appears,
   then round-trip one ping/pong to confirm the daemon is serving.
2. Background watchdog — detect exit and respawn with exponential backoff.
3. :meth:`GatewayManager.shutdown` — SIGTERM → SIGKILL the daemon on
   KiroCrew shutdown.

Gateway failures are non-fatal for KiroCrew. If the daemon crashes, the
stub's graceful-fallback path exec's the real MCP binary directly, so
sessions keep working — the only loss is the RAM sharing benefit until
the daemon recovers.
