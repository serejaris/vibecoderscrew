"""The update seam: where new code may come from, and the minimum version.

Two enterprise pins, read from the trust-root ``security_policy.json`` (see
``governance.UpdatePins``), applied at the explicit places KiroCrew replaces its
own code: ``POST /api/update`` and ``kirocrew update``. Gateway boot and status
polls remain side-effect free; update checks and applies are operator actions.

Deliberately NOT a governance archetype: a remote URL and a version number are
values the core consumes, not "is X permitted?" decisions, so they need no
``SCOPE_CATALOG`` row, no matcher, and no evaluator change.

**A pin blocks; an unresolvable pin does not.** If governance cannot be read at
all the update proceeds — refusing one would strand a host on a build that may
need a patch, and the pins are a routing constraint, not a security boundary
against a local operator who could edit the checkout directly.

    Pass *remote* for a FIXED remote name: the CLI and gateway paths run
    ``git fetch origin <branch>``, so they must validate ``origin`` rather than
    whatever the branch tracks. With no *remote*, ``branch.<name>.remote`` is
    resolved instead — that is the API path's bare ``git pull``, which follows the
    tracked remote. Validating a different remote than the one fetched would
    approve one source and install another.

    ``ls-remote --get-url`` (not ``remote get-url``) additionally applies
    ``url.<base>.insteadOf`` rewriting, so the value checked is the URL git
    resolves rather than the one merely written down.

    permitted" and an unpinned host ignores.
