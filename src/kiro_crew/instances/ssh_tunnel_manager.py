# Modified 2026 by Sereja Ris for VibecodersCrew (community fork of Kiro Crew).
# See NOTICE and CHANGELOG.md for the nature of the modifications.
"""Inbound SSH tunnel manager for the Instances feature.

Adapts the supervised-child + state-machine design of
``kiro_crew.tunnel.manager.TunnelManager`` (which points *outward* to expose the
dashboard) to point *inward*: for each connected remote instance it supervises a
local ``ssh -N -L 127.0.0.1:LP:127.0.0.1:RP <ssh_host>`` child that forwards a
loopback port to the remote KiroCrew's dashboard port.

Design note: a literal ``ssh -fN`` would make ssh fork into the background and
the foreground process exit immediately, which would leave the gateway unable to
supervise or kill the real forwarder. A gateway-supervised child must stay in the
foreground, so we use ``-N`` (no remote command) *without* ``-f``, mirroring how
``TunnelManager`` supervises its own child. ``ExitOnForwardFailure=yes`` ensures
ssh exits if the local forward can't be bound, so a failed connect is detected
rather than hanging.

Scope: explicit connect, disconnect, status, and shutdown-all, with port
allocation + token mint wired in. A local health-probe loop detects a dead
forward, but no callback opens a replacement tunnel; reconnect requires an
owner action.

Security (standard practices): loopback-bound forwards only (never ``0.0.0.0``);
ssh invoked via argv list (no local shell); ``ssh_host`` / ``remote_bin``
injection-validated before use; minted tokens held in memory only and never
logged.
