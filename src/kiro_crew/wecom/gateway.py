"""WeCom (企业微信) channel startup -- wired into the gateway boot.

``maybe_start_wecom`` is the single guarded entry point. When the channel is
enabled + credentialed it builds the :class:`WeComDispatcher` +
:class:`WeComTransport` + the low-level :class:`WeComClient`, wires the client's
inbound WS frames into ``transport.receive`` (authorize + normalize ->
dispatcher), then opens the outbound WebSocket via ``transport.connect()``.
Failures are logged and swallowed so a WeCom problem never takes down the
gateway.

The turn itself runs on the shared ``TurnDriver`` (credential/exfil redaction +
tool-approval ladder + SEL audit) via the dispatcher -- no hand-rolled loop.
