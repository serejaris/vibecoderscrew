# Skills

Skills are markdown files that give KiroCrew specialized knowledge for specific
workflows. They live in `~/.kiro/crew/skills/` as `SKILL.md` files.

## How Skills Work

- **Always-on skills**: full content injected into every session (use sparingly)
- **On-demand skills**: summary loaded at session start; full content read when
  the topic comes up
- **Triggered skills**: automatically loaded when the user's message matches
  trigger words (≥70% word overlap)

## Skill Structure

```
~/.kiro/crew/skills/
├── my-skill/
│   └── SKILL.md
├── utils/
│   └── url-shortener/
│       ├── SKILL.md
│       └── shorten.sh    # auxiliary scripts
└── code/
    └── git-workflow/
        └── SKILL.md
```

Each skill is a directory containing at least `SKILL.md`. Nested directories
are supported.

## SKILL.md Format

```markdown
---
name: my-skill
description: What this skill does (shown in summaries)
always: false
triggers: keyword1, keyword2, multi word trigger
---

# Skill Content

Instructions, examples, and reference material that the agent reads
when this skill is activated.
```

### Frontmatter Fields

| Field | Required | Description |
|-------|----------|-------------|
| `name` | Yes | Display name |
| `description` | Yes | One-line summary (shown in skill listings) |
| `always` | No | `true` to inject full content every session |
| `triggers` | No | Comma-separated trigger phrases for auto-loading. Prefix with `!` for negative triggers (e.g. `!test` excludes when "test" appears) |

## Creating Skills

### Via Dashboard

Overview → Skills tab → "+ New" button → enter name and content.

### Via Chat

Ask KiroCrew: "Create a skill called X that does Y"

### Manually

Create `~/.kiro/crew/skills/my-skill/SKILL.md` with frontmatter and content.

## Built-in Skills

KiroCrew ships with built-in skills that are synced from the project's
`skills/` directory on startup. These cover common workflows like URL
shortening, code search, and writing assistance.

## Skill Sources (Priority Order)

1. `$KIROCREW_PROJECT_DIR/skills/` — project-level (edit without rebuilding)
2. Built-in skills bundled in the Python package

Both are synced into `~/.kiro/crew/skills/` on startup. Newer source files
overwrite older ones (mtime-based). User-created skills in
`~/.kiro/crew/skills/` persist as long as they don't share a name with a
project-level or built-in skill — if they do, the source version wins when
it's newer.
