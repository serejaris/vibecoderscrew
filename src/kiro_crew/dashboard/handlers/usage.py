    ``context_used`` / ``context_window`` record context-window occupancy — all
    additive and defaulted so existing callers stay valid.

    ``elapsed_ms`` is the caller's locally measured turn wall clock, used only

    measurement because there is no global turn boundary to hang one clock on.

    ``model_source`` is a provider/client used ONLY to fill ``model`` when the
    caller could not resolve one (several dispatch surfaces never pick a model
    explicitly and would otherwise record an empty string, losing the
    per-model attribution dimension). An explicit ``model`` always wins.
