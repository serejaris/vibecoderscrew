"""Shared MCP config cleanup utilities.

KiroCrew does NOT write KiroCrew-managed MCP servers to the user's global
provider MCP config (``~/.kiro/settings/mcp.json``) during normal
operation — the KiroCrew agent file is authoritative, and provider
globals are user-owned.  Remaining helpers here clean up stale
kirocrew-binary entries left over from older install methods.

Extracted from agent.py so both agent.py and cli.py can import at the
top level without circular dependencies (agent.py imports cli.py).
