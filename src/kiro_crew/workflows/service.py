"""Gateway-side workflow service: the shared registry + runner the chat tools,
the Workflows app, and result-to-chat injection all talk to (M6.3/M6.4/M6.5).

This is the single place the gateway wires the dynamic-workflows engine into the
live process: one ``RunRegistry``, a ``WorkflowRunner`` whose ``agent_fn`` runs
``ctx.agent()`` steps through the real ``SessionManager``, and a couple of
narrow async entry points (``author``, ``start``, ``status``, ``result``,
``cancel``, ``list_runs``).

Kept as a small façade so the dashboard handlers stay thin and the MCP tools
have a stable target. The gateway constructs ONE ``WorkflowService`` at startup
(``DashboardState.workflow_service``) and the handlers reach it via the request
app state — exactly like ``state.subagents`` / ``state.sessions``.

``author`` turns a natural-language intent into a validated workflow script using
the same in-session model the rest of KiroCrew uses (no new model plumbing). It
loops up to a few times until the produced script passes ``validate`` — the
authoring-reliability gates (G1/G2) cover this shape.

_AUTHOR_SYSTEM = """\
You are authoring a KiroCrew DYNAMIC WORKFLOW: one Python module that orchestrates
agents. Reply with ONLY the Python module (no prose, no code fence). It MUST be:

  META = {{"name": "<kebab-name>", "description": "<one line>", "phases": [...]}}
  async def workflow(ctx):
      ...
      return <json-serializable result>

Rules (the sandbox REJECTS violations): no imports; no open/eval/exec/__import__;
no dunder access; no time/random/uuid (use ctx.now / ctx.args). Use ONLY the ctx
surface: await ctx.agent(prompt, schema=?, label=?, phase=?), await ctx.parallel([..]),
await ctx.pipeline(items, *stages), ctx.phase(t), ctx.log(m),
ctx.nudge(idle_secs=?, message=?), ctx.budget, ctx.args. Nothing else exists on
ctx in this runtime — any other ctx attribute or method fails at runtime, so do
not invent one.

ASYNC vs SYNC — get this right or the script crashes at runtime:
  * AWAIT these (they are async): ctx.agent(...), ctx.parallel(...),
    ctx.pipeline(...).
  * Do NOT await these (they are SYNCHRONOUS and return a context manager):
    ctx.phase(title), ctx.log(msg), ctx.nudge(...). NEVER
    ``await ctx.phase("read")`` (awaiting raises TypeError immediately).
    Both calling styles work:
      ctx.phase("read")           # bare call — sets the phase
      with ctx.phase("read"):    # context manager — purely cosmetic grouping
          ...                     # (no-op: phase is NOT auto-ended on block exit)

RESULTS CAN BE None — always guard before use: ctx.agent(...) returns None when
the agent dies or its output fails schema validation (after retries); a failed
thunk inside ctx.parallel(...) resolves to None. So NEVER subscript, ``.get()``,
or attribute-access an awaited result inline. Bind it first and guard:
  BAD:  url = (await ctx.agent("cut cr")).get("cr_url")        # crashes if None
  BAD:  src = (await ctx.parallel([...]))[0]["client_py"]      # crashes if None
  GOOD: cr = await ctx.agent("cut cr")
        url = cr.get("cr_url", "UNKNOWN") if isinstance(cr, dict) else "UNKNOWN"
  GOOD: reads = await ctx.parallel([...])
        first = reads[0] if reads and reads[0] else {{}}
        src = first.get("client_py", "") if isinstance(first, dict) else ""

Prefer ctx.pipeline for multi-stage work; ctx.parallel is a
barrier. ctx.parallel accepts a list of ctx.agent(...) calls directly, e.g.
``await ctx.parallel([ctx.agent(p1), ctx.agent(p2)])`` (thunks like
``lambda: ctx.agent(p)`` also work). Give each agent a UNIQUE, specific label —
when fanning out, include the per-item identity (e.g. an index or the claim/item
text), NOT just a shared category, so the live progress tree shows distinct rows:
``label="verify:c" + str(i) + ":" + claim[:30]`` rather than ``label="verify:" + facet``.

Keep agent count LEAN — agents are expensive and the host is resource-constrained.
Do NOT spawn a separate agent per claim/source. For verification use a GENERATOR +
CRITIC pair: ONE agent produces the draft/findings for a topic, then ONE critic
agent reviews/fact-checks that whole output and returns corrections — not one
verifier per individual claim. So a research workflow is roughly: one generator
per top-level facet (a handful), then one critic per facet to challenge it, then a
single synthesis agent. Prefer few strong agents over many tiny ones.

Available builtins (NOTHING else — any other name is a NameError at runtime, so do
NOT reference json, math, os, datetime, re, etc.): len, range, enumerate, zip, map,
filter, sorted, reversed, sum, min, max, abs, round, all, any, bool, int, float,
str, list, tuple, dict, set, frozenset, isinstance, issubclass, repr. Exceptions you
MAY use in try/except/raise: Exception, ValueError, TypeError, KeyError, IndexError,
RuntimeError, and the other standard error types. You may define plain module-level
helper functions. There is NO json module — return plain dicts/lists directly.

Before you reply, RE-READ your script and fix these specific failure modes: (1) any
``await ctx.phase/log/nudge`` (those are sync — drop the await); (2) any subscript,
``.get()``, or attribute access on an awaited
ctx.agent/parallel/pipeline result that is not first bound to a
variable and None-guarded; (3) any use of a name that
is not a listed builtin, ctx, or a helper you defined. Reply ONLY when the script
is clean on all three.

Author the workflow for this task:
