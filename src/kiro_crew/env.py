    server spawned against the system ``/usr/bin/node`` (v18 on AL2) instead of
    the user's mise ``node@20+``, which exits during ``initialize`` with a

    """Point *env* at a FILE: Kerberos ccache, mutating it in place.

    The gateway is a long-lived, non-login process.  On AL2023 the default
    ``krb5.conf`` uses ``KEYRING:persistent:<uid>`` for the ccache, and kernel
    keyrings are session-scoped — they are NOT visible to subprocesses spawned
    by a background daemon.  So a child (kiro-cli / claude / a pooled MCP
    backend) inheriting ``os.environ`` sees no usable ticket, and Kerberos-gated
    MCP servers (e.g. an SSO-backed MCP server) fail with
    "no Kerberos ticket" even though ``kinit`` succeeded in the user's shell.

    This mirrors :func:`_resolve_ssh_auth_sock` in ``acp.client``: repair the
    credential pointer at spawn time rather than trusting the daemon's stale
    env.  Resolution rules:

    * If ``KRB5CCNAME`` already names a non-default scheme (``FILE:`` operator
      override, or a platform-native ``KCM:`` / ``DIR:`` / ``API:`` cache),
      leave it — the caller already has a working, non-keyring ccache.
    * Only act on Linux: the ``/tmp/krb5cc_<uid>`` workaround targets the
      AL2023 ``KEYRING:persistent`` default.  On macOS the default is the
      ``KCM:`` daemon, so blindly pointing at a stale ``/tmp`` file (e.g. left
      by a prior Linux session or container mount) would hijack a working
      ccache — gate the whole thing on ``sys.platform == "linux"``.
    * Else, if ``/tmp/krb5cc_<uid>`` resolves to a regular file we own, point
      at it.
    * Else, do nothing — no ticket to find; let the MCP surface its own
      auth error rather than masking it.

    The candidate lives in ``/tmp`` (world-writable, sticky-bit), so we ``lstat``
    it first and require ownership by the current uid.  We do NOT reject a
    uid-owned symlink: sssd-krb5 / systemd-pam-krb5 legitimately ship
    ``/tmp/krb5cc_<uid>`` as a symlink into ``/run/user/<uid>/krb5cc/...`` — the
    exact keyring-default distros this fix targets.  For a uid-owned symlink we
    follow it (``os.stat``) and require the *resolved* target to be a regular
    file owned by the current uid.  A symlink or file owned by anyone else is
    rejected, which preserves the co-tenant defense (a foreign user cannot plant
    ``/tmp/krb5cc_<victim_uid>`` and have us trust it).

    ``KRB5CCNAME`` is intentionally absent from the MCP-gateway scrub list
    (``mcp_gateway.manager._SENSITIVE_ENV_PREFIXES``), so a value set here
    propagates to pooled backends as well.
