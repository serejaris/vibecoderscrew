"""One-time relocation of the data root from ``~/.kirocrew`` to ``~/.kiro/crew``.

KiroCrew historically kept all of its state — config, credentials, session
history, databases, and the governance/security trust-root — under a top-level
``~/.kirocrew`` directory. The Labs product decision consolidates Kiro-family
apps under the shared ``~/.kiro/`` base, so the data root moves to
``~/.kiro/crew``. This module performs that move once, on the first run after
the upgrade, for an existing install.

Design (deliberately simple):

* **Copy-and-overwrite, verify, then delete the source** — the legacy tree is
  copied into the new home; a conflicting file/dir at the same relative path
  is OVERWRITTEN by the legacy copy (legacy always wins), while a new-home
  entry with no legacy counterpart is left untouched. Every regular file is
  then verified present at the destination, and only after that succeeds is
  ``~/.kirocrew``'s data removed. There is no rollback copy and no backup of
  anything overwritten — once the move completes, that data is gone.
* **Virtual environments are preserved, never moved** — the wheel installer
  historically put its managed venv INSIDE the data home
  (``~/.kirocrew/venv``), so the legacy tree can contain the very interpreter
  running this migration. A venv is not relocatable and must not be deleted
  underneath a live process, so ``_PRESERVED_TOP_LEVEL_DIRS`` entries are
  neither copied nor removed, and the legacy root survives to hold them. This
  makes the migration a DATA move only.
* **Idempotent** — guarded by the caller so it runs only when the legacy home
  exists and the new home is not yet marked complete; a second call is a no-op.
* **Gateway-safe** — if a live gateway holds the legacy (or a pre-existing new)
  home's ``gateway.lock``, we skip the move for this run rather than relocating
  files out from under a running process, and the caller JOINS the live
  gateway's home (whichever side holds the lock) so its ``.local_secret``
  matches for internal IPC. The completion marker is NEVER written on a
  liveness skip — it is reserved for a verified copy — so a fail-safe
  ``_gateway_is_live`` OSError can't brand a partial home as migrated; the
  one-time copy simply completes on the next clean cold start.
* **No-op under ``KIROCREW_HOME``** — the caller only reaches here on the
  default (non-override) path, so dev/pod/worktree homes are never migrated.
* **Excludes regenerable bulk trees** — the ``models`` (sha256-pinned GGUF,
  re-downloaded on next start) and ``cache`` top-level dirs are NOT copied:
  keeping them would make the first-run copy needlessly slow for no benefit —
  the new home regenerates them, exactly as a fresh install does.

This module is a near-leaf: it imports only the stdlib plus
:mod:`kiro_crew.platform_compat` (cross-platform file lock) and
:mod:`kiro_crew.gateway_lock` (the lock filename), so importing it from the
``config.paths`` leaf does not create a heavy dependency cycle.

      copy its target; a dangling link (or a target it can't read) would raise
      and abort the whole migration, and a legacy symlink whose name collides
      with a real file already at the destination can't overwrite it either
      (``os.symlink`` refuses when the target exists). Skipping symlinks
      avoids both failure modes at the cost of not carrying them forward —
      acceptable for a data home, which has no user-facing symlinks.
    * **Non-regular special files** — Unix sockets / FIFOs / devices (e.g. a
      stale ``mcp-gateway/gateway.sock``) are runtime artifacts, not data, and
      ``copy2`` raises on them ("Operation not supported on socket"), which
      would abort the whole migration. Directory entries are otherwise kept so
      recursion continues.
    * **Bulk/regenerable top-level dirs** — ``_EXCLUDED_TOP_LEVEL_DIRS`` at the

      models or rebuildable caches forward.

      as ``apps/<name>/.venv``. Same non-relocatability, but these are NOT kept:

    coherent with reality: the LIVE GATEWAY's home when one is running
    (legacy or new — whichever holds ``gateway.lock``; joining any other home
    would desync ``.local_secret`` and 403 every internal API call), or the
    still-intact *legacy* on a copy/verification failure. A skipped migration
    retries on the next cold start.

    Every legacy file OVERWRITES a conflicting file of the same relative path
    already present at *new_home* — the legacy copy always wins on a conflict
    — while any *new_home* entry with no legacy counterpart is left untouched
    (a merge, not a wipe). *marker* is the completion-marker path (``new_home /
    MIGRATION_MARKER_NAME``); it is written only after the copy is verified, so
    an interrupted run never leaves a home that a later start would mistake for
    finished.
