"""Session-directive protocol — stateless session-bound MCP tools.

Some KiroCrew MCP tools act on *the session that called them* — arm a monitor
loop, set a chat slot's project, render a follow-up card. In the unpooled
(gateway-off) topology the MCP server cannot know which session is calling
(one ``kirocrew-core`` serves the whole runtime, and the ``/proc`` walk is
refused because a session-sharing subagent would misattribute to its parent).

Rather than invent a per-process identity source, these tools stay STATELESS:
the tool VALIDATES its arguments and returns a *directive* — a human-readable
confirmation line plus a machine-readable marker carrying the validated payload
(and NO session key). The session-aware consumer that processes the tool result
(:func:`dashboard.chat_runner._run_chat`'s ``EVENT_TOOL_RESULT`` handler, which
runs for every interactive surface and owns ``slot.key``) decodes the marker and
applies the effect against ITS OWN session, then strips the marker from the
stored transcript.

Subagent isolation is therefore STRUCTURAL, not cryptographic: a subagent's
tool result flows through the subagent's own runner, so it can only ever bind to
the subagent's session — never its parent's. There is no walk to get wrong.

FORGERY: the marker payload is model-visible (it comes back as the tool result
text), so a model *could* emit the literal bytes. The consumer defends by
honouring a directive ONLY when the tool call it arrived under was recorded — by
KiroCrew observing the tool CALL — as an MCP-served call whose CANONICAL name
(``_meta.kiro.toolName``, with ``_meta.kiro.mcpServerName`` set) is one of
:data:`DIRECTIVE_TOOLS`. That identity comes from kiro-cli's out-of-band ``_meta``
channel, NOT the ``title`` (which is LLM-authored prose for shell tools — a shell
command titled ``"monitor_start"`` whose stdout forges the marker must NOT be
honoured). The gate fails closed when ``_meta`` identity is absent. The payload
never carries a session key (the session is supplied by the consumer), and the
consumer additionally refuses native-sub-agent tool calls, which surface as flat
events in the parent loop but have no independently bindable slot. A model
echoing the marker from any non-directive (or non-MCP) tool resolves to no
directive tool and is ignored.
