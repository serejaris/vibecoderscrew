"""PyInstaller spec for the standalone KiroCrew backend binary.

Produces ``dist/kirocrew-backend/kirocrew-backend`` — a self-contained
executable that runs the full ``kirocrew`` CLI (gateway, setup, chat, …) with
NO system Python, pip, or site-packages required. The Electron desktop app
bundles this directory as ``extraResources`` and spawns
``kirocrew-backend gateway`` (see website/electron/find-bin.js + main.js).

Build (from repo root, after the frontend dist is staged into
src/kiro_crew/static/dist):

    pyinstaller packaging/kirocrew-backend.spec --noconfirm

The output is a one-folder bundle (NOT one-file): faster startup, and the
gateway can read its bundled data files from a stable on-disk layout.
