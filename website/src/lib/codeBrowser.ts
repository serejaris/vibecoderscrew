// GitHub URL helpers for this app's own repository.
// Branch/commit come from git (via the dashboard status payload). They are
// wrapped in encodeURI(), which escapes spaces / '%' / other unsafe chars while
// preserving '/' — GitHub wants '/' literal in branch refs (e.g. "feat/foo"),
// and hex commit SHAs pass through unchanged.
