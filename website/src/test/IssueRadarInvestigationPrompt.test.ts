/** The Investigate seed prompt's findings-write instruction.
 *
 * The write goes through the `issue_radar_record_investigation` MCP tool, whose
 * server holds the internal secret legitimately — NOT a direct
 * `PUT /api/apps/issue-radar/investigation`. An agent session holds no dashboard
 * credential (the access cookie is httpOnly, `KIROCREW_INTERNAL_SECRET` is
 * stripped from agent env, and `.local_secret` is on the sensitive-path
 * denylist), so a raw-HTTP write is refused with 403 every time and records no
 * findings (the verdict/summary the card renders).
 *
 * These tests pin the contract in both directions: the tool must be named, and
 * the raw-HTTP instruction must never come back.
