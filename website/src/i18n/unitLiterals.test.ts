/**
 * A number must not be glued to a unit literal.
 *
 * ## The defect
 *
 * `` `${mins}m ${secs}s` ``, `bytes + ' KB'`, `` `${pct}%` `` — a numeric value
 * concatenated with a hardcoded unit. Three things are wrong with it at once,
 * and none of them is visible in English:
 *
 *  1. **The unit is untranslatable.** `m` is `Min.` in German, `分钟` in Chinese,
 *     `мин` in Russian. A literal in the source is a literal in every language.
 *  2. **The number is not localized.** `hi` groups as `12,34,567`, `bn` renders
 *     Bengali digits, and de/fr/ru want `,` as the decimal separator.
 *  3. **The separator is not localized.** Narrow unit lists are space-joined in
 *     en/ru/fr, comma-joined in de (`6 Min., 38 Sek.`) and joined with NOTHING
 *     in zh — so even a correct pair of parts is assembled wrongly.
 *
 * `src/i18n/format.ts` answers all three: `fmtUnit` for one value, `fmtDuration`
 * for a compound, `fmtBytes` for a size, `fmtPercent` for a ratio.
 *
 * ## Why this gate exists at all
 *
 * Because the existing gates provably do not catch it. `hooks/useUptime.ts`
 * rendered `6m 38s` in all ten languages and escaped BOTH:
 *
 *  - the `no-literal-string` eslint gate, whose Tailwind-shaped `words.exclude`
 *    regex treats `Xm Xs` as a class-name token (a known false-negative class
 *    documented in `eslint.i18n.config.js`), and
 *  - the `en-XA` render detector, which skipped it because the label was solo in
 *    its block and its "unaccented word" signal requires three ASCII letters.
 *
 * Two independent gates, one string, both blind. The pattern is *syntactic*, so
 * an AST check is the right shape — and unlike the two above, this one has no
 * regex over prose to be fooled by.
 *
 * ## The rule
 *
 * Three shapes are findings, all of them "a value with a unit welded on":
 *
 *   - a template literal span:      `` `${mins}m ${secs}s` ``
 *   - string concatenation:         `bytes + ' KB'`
 *   - **JSX text after an expression**: `<span>{pct.toFixed(0)}%</span>`
 *
 * The third is the most idiomatic React spelling, and the gate matches it too.
 * Units are the measurement units this UI actually renders: time (`ms s m h d`),
 * data (`B KB MB GB TB`), rate/ratio (`%`, `x`) and compact suffixes (`K`, `M`).
 *
 * ## What is NOT a finding, and why
 *
 * **CSS values.** `` style={{ width: `${pct}%` }} ``, `el.style.height = h + 'px'`,
 * `` `height ${MS}ms ${EASE}` `` — a localized digit in a CSS length is not a
 * cosmetic problem, it is a **silently dropped value**: `lib/cssSanitize.ts`
 * guards five iframe theme surfaces with `/^[a-zA-Z0-9#(),.\- %/]+$/`, which a
 * Bengali digit fails, so the declaration is discarded entirely. Those sites MUST
 * keep bare arithmetic, so this gate excludes them by context rather than
 * inviting someone to "fix" them.
 *
 * CSS context is recognised as: a `style` JSX attribute, an object property whose
 * key is a CSS property, an assignment into `.style.*` or `setProperty`, a
 * `useMotionTemplate` call, a JSX attribute named like a dimension (`w`, `h`,
 * `size`, `delay` — a component prop that flows into a style downstream), or any
 * literal containing a CSS-only unit (`px em rem vh vw fr deg ch pt`) — a
 * template mixing `px` with `ms` is a transition shorthand, not prose.
 *
 * The dimension-prop exclusion is a NAME heuristic and therefore imprecise in
 * both directions: it cannot see that `<ShimmerLine w={`${x}%`} />` ends up in a
 * `width`, and it would wrongly excuse a genuine label passed as `size`. Deciding
 * properly needs cross-file flow analysis, which a syntactic gate does not do.
 *
 * **Machine formats with a parser on the other side.** `utils/cronUtils.tsx`
 * emits `1h`/`30m` as the wire shape `parseEveryFromSchedule` reads back with
 * `/^every\s+(\d+)\s*([sh])/`, and `utils/pasteTokens.ts` emits
 * `[ Paste #N · M lines ]` parsed back by a `\d+` regex. Localizing either
 * silently breaks the round trip. These are listed in `ROUND_TRIP` below with
 * their parser, because "it looks like display text" is exactly the trap.
 *
 * ## Known false negatives, stated explicitly
 *
 *  1. **Indirection.** A unit held in a variable (`const u = 'm'; `${n}${u}``) is
 *     not matched. No such site exists today.
 *  2. **Words, not symbols.** `` `${n} minutes` `` is not matched — the unit
 *     vocabulary is deliberately symbols-only, because matching English words
 *     would collide with ordinary prose. Those sites are caught instead by the
 *     `no-literal-string` gate, which sees a translatable word.
 *  3. **A number formatted correctly but assembled wrongly.** `${fmtNumber(n)}m`
 *     IS matched (the trailing `m` is still a literal), but
 *     `` `${fmtUnit(a,'hour')} ${fmtUnit(b,'minute')}` `` is not — a hand-joined
 *     pair of correct parts passes. `fmtDuration` exists so callers do not
 *     hand-join; this gate cannot tell that they did.
 *  4. **Scope.** Only `.ts`/`.tsx` under `src`, excluding tests.
 *
 * ## How this is enforced: two diff gates that store nothing, one ceiling
 *
 * `[added-lines]` and `[vs-base]` are the real gate. Both are ZERO-TOLERANCE and
 * store NO count anywhere: they read the base ref, so git supplies the previous
 * state and there is no number in this file for a parallel branch to regenerate.
 *
 *   - `[added-lines]` — a finding on a line this branch wrote. No exemption.
 *   - `[vs-base]` — a file this branch touched holds MORE findings than it did at
 *     the base. Catches the two things line attribution cannot: an edit that turns
 *     an exempt site into a real one without touching the finding's own line, and
 *     an offsetting add-and-remove that leaves the whole-repo count flat.
 *
 * `BASELINE` is the third and weakest — one UPWARD-ONLY whole-repo ceiling over the
 * frozen debt on lines nobody touched, which exists only because a hard zero would
 * fail on arrival. Lowering it is OPTIONAL and never required to land a change.
 * That is the point: an exact-equality ratchet fails every branch that FIXES a site
 * and orders it to edit one shared number, which is a merge conflict between all of
 * them and buys no enforcement the two diff gates do not already provide. The goal
 * is 0, at which point the constant and its test are deleted.
 *
 * Per the standing project rule: this is a syntactic floor, not a measurement of
 * "all unlocalized units". The render-time gate in Phase 5 is the ground truth.
