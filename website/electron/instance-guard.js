// Modified 2026 by Sereja Ris for VibecodersCrew (community fork of Kiro Crew).
// See NOTICE and CHANGELOG.md for the nature of the modifications.
/**
 * instance-guard.js — cross-app gateway ownership guard.
 *
 * The nightly app ("VibecodersCrew Nightly.app") and the production app
 * ("VibecodersCrew.app") are separate INSTALLS sharing ONE data home
 * (~/.kiro/crew), and ONE gateway port (5476). That makes the port a mutex:
 * only one VibecodersCrew-family gateway may run at a time. Electron's
 * requestSingleInstanceLock is keyed on userData (per productName), so it
 * cannot stop "VibecodersCrew Nightly" launching while "VibecodersCrew" runs — this
 * module covers that cross-app seam.
 *
 * Decision inputs: our own stamped version (identity family derives from it,
 * mirroring auto-update.js channelForVersion), the running gateway's
 * /api/health payload ({ok, app, version}), and who LOCALLY owns the port's
 * LISTEN socket. Legacy gateways (health without identity fields) and
 * source-run dev gateways keep today's reuse behavior — the guard only
 * interposes when BOTH sides are positively identified, their families differ,
 * AND the port is held by a local VibecodersCrew process. That last input is what
 * separates a local rival from a REMOTE gateway forwarded in over `ssh -L`,
 * which the health payload alone cannot distinguish.
 *
 * Pure logic only — the Electron shell (main.js) owns the dialog, the
 * quit-by-name AppleScript, the port-owner probe, and the port-free wait.
