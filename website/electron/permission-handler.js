// Modified 2026 by Sereja Ris for VibecodersCrew (community fork of Kiro Crew).
// See NOTICE and CHANGELOG.md for the nature of the modifications.
// Renderer permission gating for the VibecodersCrew Electron app.
//
// Why this exists: without an explicit handler, Electron's default permission
// *check* can report `media` as denied for the renderer's getUserMedia(), so
// the chat input's mic button silently no-ops in the packaged app even though
// it works in a plain browser (Chromium prompts there). These handlers grant
// the microphone and deny everything else, per least privilege. Screen capture
// has its own seam (display-media.js) and is unaffected.
//
// ── The bug this module fixes ────────────────────────────────────────────────
//
// Voice input was denied in the packaged app while working in Chrome at the
// SAME origin, with the SAME macOS (TCC) grant, on the SAME device — proving by
// isolation that the denial came from this layer and not from the OS. The
// renderer saw `NotAllowedError` from getUserMedia even though
// navigator.permissions.query({name:'microphone'}) reported "granted" and
// device labels were populated (Chromium only exposes labels post-grant).
//
// The original CHECK handler had two independent defects:
//
//     setPermissionCheckHandler((wc, permission, _origin, details) => {
//       if (permission === "media") return isAppOrigin(wc) && details?.mediaType === "audio";
//       return false;
//     });
//
//   1. `wc` MAY BE NULL. Electron passes a null webContents for permission
//      checks that don't originate from a live frame. The old isAppOrigin then
//      ran `new URL("")`, threw, and returned false — a deny. Meanwhile
//      `_origin`, the origin STRING Electron supplies for exactly this case,
//      was discarded. That is the bug this module's two-source origin check
//      closes.
//   2. `mediaType === "audio"` is an exact match, so any other value — notably
//      'unknown', which Chromium uses on some paths — also denied.
//
// Either defect alone produces the observed asymmetry: permissions.query()
// arrives with a real frame and mediaType 'audio' (granted), while
// getUserMedia's internal check arrives without one (denied). The fix covers
// both, so it holds regardless of which fired.
//
// ── The rule ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
//
// Deny only when video is EXPLICITLY requested. Audio-only and unspecified both
// pass. That keeps the camera gated while making the mic robust to absent or
// renamed detail fields. Non-`media` permissions are still denied wholesale.
//
// A denial logs one line to the main-process console, because diagnosing this
// previously required attaching a debugger to the main process — the handlers
// were silent, so a deny was indistinguishable from an OS refusal.
//
// Pure logic with the origin lookup injected, so both handlers are unit
// testable without a live Electron session — mirroring display-media.js.

/**
 * True when the request belongs to the app's own dashboard.

 *   - `wc.getURL()` — available for frame-originated requests.
 *   - `origin` — the string Electron passes to the CHECK handler, and the ONLY
 *     signal when `wc` is null. Ignoring it is what denied the microphone.
 *
 * Both are parsed as URLs and compared on hostname; never substring-matched, so
 * `http://localhost.evil.example/` cannot pass. The shell always loads
 * `http://localhost:<port>` (main.js BACKEND_URL) and remote hosts are SSH
 * forwards onto that same loopback port, so hostname is a stable identity.

 * @param {string} [origin] - securityOrigin string, when Electron supplies one

 * absent). Logging each one floods the main-process console with dozens of
 * lines per session that carry ZERO diagnostic value: they are always denied and
 * always will be.
 *
 * The ONE denial worth seeing is the class this module exists to catch — a
 * `media` request that should have been GRANTED (audio or unspecified) but was
 * refused, i.e. the silent-mic regression documented above. In healthy
 * operation this never fires for the app origin (such a request is granted), so
 * a line here is a real signal, not noise. Video is by-design and is checked on
 * every route, so it is not noteworthy either.

 *
 * ── The macOS (TCC) leg ──────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * Granting at the Electron layer is necessary but NOT sufficient on macOS: the
 * OS gates the mic separately, and its prompt is ONE-SHOT — once a user is
 * 'denied', macOS never asks again, so a bare deny is a permanent dead end
 * ("permission denied" with no prompt and nothing obvious to click). This
 * handler therefore mirrors display-media.js's screen-capture treatment:
 *
 *   - 'granted'         -> grant.
 *   - 'not-determined'  -> ask macOS NOW (the user just clicked the mic, so the
 *                          prompt is in-context) and honor the answer.
 *   - 'denied'/'restricted' -> deny AND surface a recovery route to System
 *                          Settings; the OS will not re-prompt on its own.
 *
 * The TCC leg is OPT-IN via injected deps: with no `getMicAccessStatus` the
 * handler stays fully synchronous and behaves exactly as before (non-darwin
 * platforms and unit tests take that path).
 *
 * @param {object} [deps]
 * @param {(wc: unknown, origin?: string) => boolean} [deps.isAppOrigin] - injectable for tests
 * @param {(...args: unknown[]) => void} [deps.onDeny] - injectable for tests
