 * Graceful gateway stop, extracted from main.js for testability.
 *
 * The embedded Python gateway is a long-running child process. Before quit
 * (and before any Squirrel auto-update bundle swap) it must be stopped
 * cleanly: POST /api/shutdown so it flushes session/memory/cron state and
 * exits itself, falling back to SIGTERM then SIGKILL. main.js injects the live
 * child process + module-level config; tests inject a real spawned process and
 * a local HTTP server. Deps (http/fs/path/timers) are injectable so the logic
 * is unit-testable without Electron.

/**
 * Force-stop whatever VibecodersCrew process is LISTENing on `port`, then VERIFY the
 * port actually freed before reporting success.
 *
 * The old inline version SIGKILLed the owner and resolved after a fixed 800ms
 * delay, treating "signal accepted" as "process dead". That is wrong for a
 * gateway wedged in an uninterruptible kernel wait (macOS `U` state, e.g. a
 * blocking close() on a dead socket): SIGKILL is queued but never delivered, so
 * the process lives on and keeps the port. The caller then respawned into a
 * guaranteed "address already in use" and surfaced a confusing "exited code 1".
 *
 * This version polls the listener set after killing and returns `freed` based on
 * whether the port is ACTUALLY free afterwards (not merely whether our targets
 * died), plus `survivors` (the VibecodersCrew PIDs we tried to kill that are
 * still holding the port) and `foreignHolder` (a non-VibecodersCrew process
 * still owns it).
 * `freed === false` means a respawn would just fail to bind — the caller MUST
 * NOT respawn; it should tell the user a restart is required (`survivors`, an
 * unkillable wedge) or that another app holds the port (`foreignHolder`).
 *
 * All side effects are injected so this is unit-testable without Electron or a
 * real OS process:
 *   - getListenPids(port) -> Promise<number[]>   (lsof -t)
 *   - getCommand(pid)     -> Promise<string>     (ps -o command=)
 *   - kill(pid, signal)                          (process.kill; may throw)
 *   - sleep(ms)           -> Promise<void>

 *   "none"     — nothing is listening locally, yet something answered. A race,
 *                or a socket we cannot see; treat as not ours.
